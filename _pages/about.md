I received a Ph.D. in Informatics at from the [Graduate school of Informatics, Kyoto University](https://www.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/). My current research is focused on applying blockchain technology to learning analytics with the ultimate goal of advancing learning analytics through seamless sharing of learning records for analytics between learning providers and learners with enforced privacy and security control mechanisms.


I have a bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) where I graduated with distinction (honours). Some of my coursework include Software Engineering, Algorithms, Data Structures, Systems Engineering, Computer Architecture, Microprocessor Systems and Design, Communication Networks, Programming Languages, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Computational Methods and Statistics.


With four years plus work experience, I have worked at different companies including Education, Banking, E-commerce and Energy companies. During this time, I deployed skills in software engineering (developing web and mobile applications, database design, setup and management, writing algorithms to enhance processes and optimize resource usage), product ideation (conceptualization, prototyping, user interface design, heuristic evaluation), data analysis among others. I also acquired excellent interpersonal, communication and leadership skills while interacting with multiple teams with different backgrounds.


I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for discovering new ways to solving problems. I enjoy working in a challenging environment with a focused team. I like swimming, playing challenging games and coding for fun!
