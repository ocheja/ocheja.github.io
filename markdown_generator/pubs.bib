    abstract = { The use of blockchain in education has become one of the trending topics in education technology research. However, only a handful of education blockchain solutions have provided a measure of the impact on students' learning outcomes, teaching, or administrative processes. This work reviews how academic data stored on the blockchain is being visualized across various education blockchain solutions. We argue that education's uniqueness requires a different visualization approach that supports students' learning activities, advances teaching methods, and facilitates administrative procedures. We identify a consistent trend where most of the proposed education blockchain solutions focus on credentials collection and do not provide a way to make sense of the blockchain's data. Thus, we conducted a needs analysis by interviewing four teachers to understand essential features when accessing distributed academic data, report these results and use them to inform the features of our proposed visualizations. Our unique contributions include: presenting typical use cases of distributed learning records from multiple education institutes and demonstrating how past learning records of students stored on the blockchain can be visualized to support current learning. We also propose a method of visualization to increase the data awareness of information owners through the blockchain. }
